    This is an adaptation of the model of the 3DR Iris Quadrotor. The original model has been created by
    Thomas Gubler and is maintained by Lorenz Meier. This model includes two cylindrical wings, below the
    center of the main frame, connected to it by revolute joints that allow rotation around the y-axis.
