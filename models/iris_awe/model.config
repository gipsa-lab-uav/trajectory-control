    This is an adaptation of the model of the 3DR Iris Quadrotor. The original model has been created by
    Thomas Gubler and is maintained by Lorenz Meier. This model composes the Iris model together with an
    Airborn Wind Energy System, which is composed by a station, a cable and a drone. The cable is attached
    below the center of the main frame, connected to it by a revolute joint.
