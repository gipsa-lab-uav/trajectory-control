    This is an adaptation of the model of the 3DR Iris Quadrotor. The original model has been created by
    Thomas Gubler and is maintained by Lorenz Meier. This model composes the Iris model together with the 
    Magnus wings model, which is composed by two cylindrical wings put together by a main link through 
    revolute joints, ideally placed below the center of the main frame, connected to it by a fixed joint.
